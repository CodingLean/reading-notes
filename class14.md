# Explain why we need domain modeling.

- Agile enterprise to carry out a common language and a fundamental structure important for the analysis of features and epics

# Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

- Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users: screen readers, used by blind people, interpret the tags that exist in an HTML page and read out the contents to the user. Because tables are not the right tool for layout, and the markup is more complex than with CSS layout techniques, the screen readers' output will be confusing to their users.
Tables produce tag soup: As mentioned above, table layouts generally involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques. This can result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug.
Tables are not automatically responsive: When you use proper layout containers (such as header, section, article, or div), their width defaults to 100% of their parent element. Tables on the other hand are sized according to their content by default, so extra measures are needed to get table layout styling to effectively work across a variety of devices.

# What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

- A constructor is just a function called using the new keyword, and an advantage of using it is being alot more short hand.

# How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

- in concstructors you use 'this' to bind to the new object. and object literals refers to the current code being written.

# Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

- prototypes are the simpler way of attaching and manipulating more things and inheritance 

# Things I want to know more about 

- I want to learn more about anything other than javascript. Joking,, but JS is such a needed headache im actually happy to get toknow more.
