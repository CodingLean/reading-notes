# Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

- the quality of video and audio, the rendering and everything about media and the internet has changed significantlly and evolved honeslty by quality control and pushing tech every year. 

## Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the video element.

- attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At a minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.

## Why is it important to have fallback content inside the video element?

- so the user can at least access it some way regardless of what browser they are using.



## Write a very short story where audio and video are characters.

- One day a man went on a walk for entertainment. A video walks by and shows him and he gets a laugh.. 2 mins after audio came by and had him listen.. they found eachother and put it together the man laughed so hard he died.. he was 109 years old.

# How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

- Flex has one Directional flow. Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems

# Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

- The element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items. In this example container is the grid container.

- The children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container. Here the item elements are grid items, but sub-item isn’t.

- The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column. Here the yellow line is an example of a column grid line.

# Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

- in case you cross platforms to handheld devices as well as making sure your user can actually still utilize the page.

# Define the following img attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

- One or more strings separated by commas, indicating possible image sources for the user agent to use. Each string is composed of:
- A URL to an image
- Optionally, whitespace followed by one of:
- A width descriptor a positive integer directly followed by w). The width descriptor is divided by the source size given in the sizes attribute to calculate the effective pixel density.
- A pixel density descriptor a positive floating point number directly followed by x.

# How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

- you can manipulate srcset using descriptors.
