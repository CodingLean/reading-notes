# What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

# Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error. 

- Syntax errors- These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through â€” you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!
- Logic errors- These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you want it to be, meaning that the program runs correct but gives incorrect results. These are typically harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

# List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

 - A lot of my errors were due to syntax errors missing commas or having extras in side of funtions.
  

# How will this topic continue to influence your long-term goals?
 - Troubleshooting will always be a part of this job/career so it is something we all need to work on continously so we understand faster and more efficient was to go about it.

## The JavaScript Debugger.

#How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

 - When you are writing your code and are not sure why it is not working this tool can help you understand what went wrong

Define what a breakpoint is. 

- It is a tool to put a pause in your Javascript.

#What is the call stack? 

- The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that initiates a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
