A Growth Mindset is to me, is one that youre constantly getting better, resilient and able to overcome any obstacle because of the mind. Also manifests creativity and the ability to see and set potetially higher and better goals for yourself.

How do you stay in the Growth Mindset?
>- Think Positive thoughts to encourage positive outcomes.
>- Take a break when things seem hard.
>- Take deep breaths


## NOTES
>- You can use multiple "#" to size your headings and fonts and also there are more ways that you can change font sizes.
>- Markdown paragraphs only need a blank line to space. best practice is not to use any tabs or spaces.
>- You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Then wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().
