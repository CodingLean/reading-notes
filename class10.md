# Importance of semantics.

- One of HTML's main jobs is to give text meaning , so that the browser knows how to display it correctly. 

# Heading Levels

- There are six heading elements, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Each element represents a different level of content in the document; h1 represents the main heading, h2 represents subheadings, h3> represents sub-subheadings, and so on.

# The use of SUP & SUB

-You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript when marking up items like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning. The sup and sub elements handle this job.

# ABBR

- Another fairly common element you'll meet when looking around the Web is abbr — this is used to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym. When including either, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the abbr to mark up the abbreviation. This provides a hint to user agents on how to announce/display the content while informing all users what the abbreviation means.
If providing the expansion in addition to the abbreviation makes little sense, and the abbreviation or acronym is a fairly shortened term, provide the full expansion of the term as the value of title attribute

# Applying CSS to HTML

- External stylesheet; An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we linked an external stylesheet to our web page.
- Internal stylesheet; An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, you place CSS inside a style element contained inside the HTML head.

- Inline syles; Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute. The implementation of an inline style in an HTML document might look like this:

# Stay away from inline?

-It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.

- Strict equality; This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.
- Not, Does-not-equal; This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.
- Addition; Add two numbers together or combine two strings.

# Real World Solutions w/ Funtions

# Comparison Operators

- === and !== — test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another.
- < and > — test if one value is less than or greater than another.
- <= and >= — test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.

# The difference Between || and &&

- && — AND; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that all of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
- || — OR; allows you to chain together two or more expressions so that one or more of them have to individually evaluate to true for the whole expression to return true.
