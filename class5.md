# What are Variables?
Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
In this example, x, y, and z, are variables.

# When to Use JavaScript const?
If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.

If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.

# JavaScript Identifiers
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

>- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
>- Names must begin with a letter
>- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
>- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
>- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
