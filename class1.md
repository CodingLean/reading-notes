A Growth Mindset is to me, is one that youre constantly getting better, resilient and able to overcome any obstacle because of the mind. Also manifests creativity and the ability to see and set potetially higher and better goals for yourself.


How do you stay in the Growth Mindset?
>- Think Positive thoughts to encourage positive outcomes.
>- Take a break when things seem hard.
>- Take deep breaths
